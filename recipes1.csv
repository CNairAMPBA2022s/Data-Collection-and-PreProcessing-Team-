The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil.Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. It can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney. This vada sambar meal is finished with steaming hot filter coffee.""]}]"

Set the pan aside on the kitchen countertop.Let the milk become warm at room temperature.To check if the milk has become warm dip your little finger (touch method) into the milk\xa0and you should\xa0feel warm and not hot. Second way is to touch the sides of the pan and it should feel warm and not hot. The third way is to check with a food thermometer and it should have a temperature between 39 to 44 degrees celsius or 102 to 111 degree fahrenheit.Once the milk has become warm, you can use the same pan for setting curd or transfer the warm milk in another bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of curd starter to the milk and mix thoroughly with a small wired whisk.Cover with lid and allow the milk to ferment for 5 to 6 hours or until the curd is setDepending on the temperature it may take more hours. You can also use Instant pot yogurt function to set the curd.On fermentation the curd will have a pleasant fermented aroma and with a slight tangy taste and it will also have a wobbly thick texture.Once the curd is made, refrigerate it so that it does not get overfermented. If you need sour curd for any recipe then keep the curd for a couple of hours at room temperature.

Here I used organic jaggery. But if you are using regular jaggery block, then you will have to melt the jaggery in warm water and filter to get rid of impurities. For this, heat 1/3 cup water and let it become warm. Then add 1/3 cup powdered or grated jaggery. Let the jaggery melt. Filter this solution and add it at the next step.Now add 1/3 cup water and stir well so that the jaggery dissolves.Bring this mixture to a gentle simmer on a low to medium flame. The pineapple pieces should get softened. Overall cook for about 5 to 6 minutes after adding water.Add 1/2 tsp cardamom powder.Add 1 cup thick coconut milk. You can use home made or store brought.Stir very well and switch off the flame.Add the fried cashews, raisins and stir well. Reserve a few cashews and raisins for garnish.Serve pineapple payasam hot or warm or chilled garnished with the reserved cashews and raisins. On cooling, the consistency thickens.']}]"
